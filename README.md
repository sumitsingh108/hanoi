## Tower of Hanoi (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)
A clean, responsive, and interactive Tower of Hanoi implementation built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or external libraries required.

## Features

Play the game manually: click a source peg, then a destination peg

Rule enforcement: prevents illegal moves (no larger disk on a smaller one)

Auto-solve mode: watch the optimal solution with adjustable speed

Dynamic disk count: choose between 3 to 10 disks

Move counter: tracks your progress and shows the theoretical minimum

Responsive design: works on desktop and mobile

Modern UI: gradient disks, animated moves, and clear status indicators

## Tech Stack

HTML5 – structure

CSS3 – modern styling & responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – game logic and auto-solver
